## üîß Usage

After installation, you can use the `advanced_snapshot` service to take snapshots from your camera entities. To call the service, use the following YAML:

```yaml
service: advanced_snapshot.take_snapshot
data:
  camera_entity_id: camera.your_camera_front_door
  file_path: frontdoor.jpg
  file_path_backup: {{ now().strftime('%y%m%d')}}/{{now().strftime('%H%M%S')}}_frontdoor.jpg
  crop: [100, 100, 400, 300]  # (x, y, width, height)
  crop_aspect_ratio: "16:9"
  add_bar: true
  custom_text_left: "Front Door"
  custom_text_middle: "{{ states('sensor.garten_actual_temperature') }} ¬∞C"
  custom_text_right: "{{ now().strftime('%d.%m.%y %H:%M:%S') }}"
  setting_font_path: "Arial.ttf"
  setting_font_size: "auto"
  setting_font_color: "black"
  setting_bar_height: 7%
  setting_bar_color: "white"
  setting_bar_position: "bottom"
```

### Parameters

- **camera_entity_id (Required):** The entity ID of the camera you want to capture a snapshot from.

- **file_path_backup (Optional):** A backup path can be either a relative or an absolute path. If a relative path is provided, it will be completed based on the configuration.
- **crop (Optional):** Defines the cropping area as [x, y, width, height]. If an aspect ratio is set, height will be ignored.
- **crop_aspect_ratio (Optional):** Optional aspect ratio (e.g., '16:9'). If set, the height in 'crop' will be ignored and calculated automatically.
- **add_bar (Optional):** If set to `true`, a text bar will be added to the snapshot.
- **custom_text_left, custom_text_middle, custom_text_right (Optional):** Texts to be displayed on the left, center, and right of the bar.
- **setting_font_path (Optional):** The font path can be either a relative or an absolute path. If a relative path is provided, it will be completed based on the configuration. (defaults to `Arial.ttf`).
- **setting_font_size (Optional):** Font size for the text bar. (number oder 'auto')
- **setting_font_color (Optional):** Color of the text (default is `black`). You can use color names like white, black, etc., as well as RGB values in the format RGB(255,255,255).

- **setting_bar_color (Optional):** Color of the bar (default is `white`). You can use color names like white, black, etc., as well as RGB values in the format RGB(0,0,0).
- **setting_bar_position (Optional):** Position of the bar (`top` or `bottom`).

### Response

```
success: true

```

## üí° Troubleshooting

If the service does not work as expected, please ensure the following:

- The **camera_entity_id** is correct and the camera is functioning properly.
- The **file_path** is accessible and Home Assistant has permission to write to the directory.
- Ensure you are using the correct image file formats (e.g., PNG, JPG).
- If you're receiving errors with the text bar, verify the font file path and font size.
