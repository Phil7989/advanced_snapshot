- **Crop images** before saving them.
- **Save snapshots** to a specified path and optionally create backups.

## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a working Home Assistant setup and that you have the necessary permissions to install custom integrations.

1. Download the custom integration folder.
2. Place the folder in your Home Assistant configuration directory:  
   `config/custom_components/advanced_snapshot/`

3. Restart Home Assistant.

### Configuration

Add the following configuration to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml

advanced_snapshot:
```

Alternatively, you can configure the service via the Home Assistant UI under **Configuration** > **Integrations**.

## üîß Usage

After installation, you can use the `advanced_snapshot` service to take snapshots from your camera entities. To call the service, use the following YAML:

```yaml

  camera_entity_id: camera.your_camera_front_door
  file_path: /config/www/frontdoor.jpg

    now().strftime('%H%M%S')}}_frontdoor.jpg
  crop: [100, 100, 400, 300]  # (x, y, width, height)
  add_bar: true
  custom_text_left: "Front Door"
  custom_text_middle: "{{ states('sensor.garten_actual_temperature') }} ¬∞C"
  custom_text_right: "{{ now().strftime('%d.%m.%y %H:%M:%S') }}"
  setting_font_path: "/config/custom_components/advanced_snapshot/Arial.ttf"
  setting_font_size: 20
  setting_font_color: "black"
  setting_bar_height: 40
  setting_bar_color: "white"

### Response



## üí° Troubleshooting

If the service does not work as expected, please ensure the following:

- The **camera_entity_id** is correct and the camera is functioning properly.
- The **file_path** is accessible and Home Assistant has permission to write to the directory.
- Ensure you are using the correct image file formats (e.g., PNG, JPG).
- If you're receiving errors with the text bar, verify the font file path and font size.
